# Certified

An idiomatic framework for using certificates
and cookies (macaroons/biscuits) within python web API-s.

We make the following design choices:

* mTLS - mutual transport layer certificates (x509) authenticate
  client and server to one another

* scopes - clients can "prove" they have access to a scope
  (e.g. admin) by including it within their 'certificatePolicies'
  *at the handshake* phase

* cookies - we rely on the [datalog model of biscuits](https://doc.biscuitsec.org/reference/datalog)
  to exchange cookies that carry authorization proofs.
  Because Certified warehouses certificates 

* symmetry - symmetric ideas are used for setting up client and server
  cryptographic trust and certificate issuance.  This allows
  servers to act as clients in complex workflows, and clients
  to act as servers to run callbacks.

* key management - we prescribe a file layout for these.
  Key file-names serve as a short-hand for referencing a
  given client/server.  See [docs/keys](docs/keys.md).

How do I know who originated an API request -- what organization
they come from, and what kinds of organizational policies they have
been asked to follow?

How can I consistently apply my own site's security policy
to API actions?

And -- the big question -- how can I, as a client using an API,
obtain, manage, and send these credentials to servers I interact
with?

The certified package has you covered.
